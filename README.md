## About me

My name is Damian. I am an Wroclaw University of Technology graduate. On both Bachelor and Master level I was majoring in Automation and Control Systems. 
I consider myself a well organized, reliable person who is willing to face challenges and learn new things. As a person with strong interpersonal skills I can easily work as a team player. 
I am familiar with software life-cycle and testing methods according to ISTQB syllabus. My main goal is to turn theoretical knowledge into practical skillset.
